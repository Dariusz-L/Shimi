# Shimi

  Shimi's reason of existence is to let you fake return values of any static or instance method or property, so you can test your code without unnecessarily introducing abstractions over your classes. This is free alternative to huge and expensive libraries like Microsoft Fakes, TypeMock or JustMock. This library is built on top of [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), which lets easily replace a code at runtime.
